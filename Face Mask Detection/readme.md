# Face Mask Detection ML Model 


__In the era of Covid-19 pandemic situation, the wearing of face mask is mandatory especially in the public areas. 
In public areas, where the chance of spreading the virus is very high, there must be a device running on a  
advanced ML Model, which can detect people who are not wearing the mask and can alert authorites to take  
concern actions against them.__

__The model that I built can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi device connecting to a camera can installed on public areas 
and help humanity to minimize the spreading of virus.__
