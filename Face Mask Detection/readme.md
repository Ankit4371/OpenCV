# Face Mask Detection ML Model


__In the era of Covid-19 pandemic situation, the wearing of face mask is mandatory especially in the public areas. 
In public areas, where the chance of spreading the virus is very high, there must be a device running on a  
advanced ML Model, which can detect people who are not wearing the mask and can alert authorites to take  
concern actions against them.__

__The model that I built can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi device connecting to a camera can installed on public areas 
and help humanity to minimize the spreading of virus.__

In this folder, there are two files.
1. The Convolutional Neural Network Model which can distinguish between the faces of people that are wearing masks or not.

2. The OpenCV file which uses this model to get the result on real time basis.
