## Real time Face Mask Detection using ML and OpenCV.

**Why do we need face mask detection?**

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, wearing of face mask is mandatory in whole worldIn the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging. But, it’s must need model to build to fight current and post pandemic situation.
